# Where is the database and where does it store its files?
- Its located in the persistence.xml file. Im using the H2-database, an in-memory and lightweight Java database.
- data will be stored in a file named DB.mv.db in my root directory, according to the connection url.

# How/when does the database run?
- The database is initialized and runs within the same JVM process as my application.
- All data changes are persisted to the file DB.mv.db.
- When the application shuts down, the H2 database also stops.
- The data will be whiped out the next time i start because schema creation mode is set to 'create'.

To summarize, the H2 database runs within my application's JVM process, starting when the first database connection is made and
stopping when my application stops. I don't need to manually start or stop the H2 database when using it in embedded mode.

# Where do the getters/setters used in the setUp() method come from?

They are coming from the respective classes. 


# SQL used to create the customer table:
Hibernate:
create table Customer (
id bigint generated by default as identity,
name varchar(255),
primary key (id)
)

# Find a way to inspect the database tables being created and attach a screenshot of the database schema to your report. Do the created tables correspond to your initial thoughts regarding the exercise?
I didnt manage to inspect the database tables. 


# Technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved:
- Didnt manage to view database schema.

# An explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created:

I set the hibernate.show_sql in persistence.xml to true to see the sql that created the database tables.
